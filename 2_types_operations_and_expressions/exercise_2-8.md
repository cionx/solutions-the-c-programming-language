# Exercise 2-8

> Write a function `rightrot(x, n)` that returns the value of the integer `x` rotated to the right by `n` bit positions.



If the size of `unsigned int` is `k` bits, then rotating `k` times results in the original `x`.
We can therefore reduce `n` modulo `k` to prevent unnecessary rotations.
To this end, we need to find out `k`.
The value can be found in `limits.h` as `UINT_WIDTH`, but for some reason, this macro doesnâ€™t seem to be properly exported.
We therefore use the (not-yet introduced) `sizeof` operator to determine this `width`:
```c
unsigned int rightrot(unsigned int x, int n) {
	int width = 8 * sizeof(unsigned int);
	// UINT_WIDTH from limits.h doesn't work for some reason.
	n %= width;
```
We want to split `x` into two parts: the first `n` bits from the right, which we shall call the `tail`, and the rest of `n`, which we shall call the `head`.
We need to swap the positions of `head` and `tail`.
This can be done by shifting the head `n` places to the right, and the tail `width - n` places to the left.
```c
	unsigned int mask = ~(~0u << n); // n many 1's right-adjusted
	unsigned int head = x & ~mask;
	unsigned int tail = x & mask;
	return (head >> n) | (tail << (width - n));
}
```
